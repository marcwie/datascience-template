# Science template

This is a minimal template for my (data) science projects. Requires [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). 

# Usage

After creating a new repository from this template simply run ```make install```.

The template has the following structure:

```
.
├── Makefile
├── README.md
├── data
│   ├── 00_external
│   ├── 01_raw
│   ├── 02_processed
│   └── 03_derived
├── notebooks
├── output
├── pyproject.toml
├── scripts
│   └── execute_notebooks.sh
└── src
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── colors.py
    └── styling.py
```

This is a reduced version of what you might find when using the standard ```cookiecutter-data-science``` template with the addition of relying on [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for package management. 

```data``` holds all necessary external, raw and derived data. All ```jupyter```-notebooks are supposed to in ```notebook```. Visual output is placed in ```output```. 

```scripts``` holds all shell-scripts and other potential helpers. Modify ```execute_notebooks.sh``` in order to execute a chosen set of ```jupyter```-notebooks. This is pretty useful when you have a couple of ```jupyter```-notebooks that put figures into ```output``` and want to run all of them at once. 

```src``` is installed in the project's virtual environment. Use it to package code that you want to use in your notebooks. Includes a small collection of preset functionality that I typically need.
